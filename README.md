# League Central
## Website Overview
The increased global popularity and following of football has resulted in people seeking real-time match updates and detailed information about the matches, players, teams, and leagues. There are other existing solutions out there but they often lack integrations in live scores, schedules, league information, user experience personalization and a marketplace feature. Our website, **LeagueCentral**, aims to fill this need by providing a single window for all updates and information related to football, serving the needs of fans and enthusiasts.
